# TRILLO APP

Project realized during the ["Advanced CSS and Sass"](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Demo visible here: https://trillo-msz.netlify.app/

The application is static but totally responsive. it has no backend or database, nor does it communicate with any RestApi.
It was created for simple study purposes, nevertheless it is possible to download and use it, without specifying however that the author of the design is Jonas Schmedtmann and the front end developer is Maurizio Strazzullo.
